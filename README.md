# portfolio-simple-website


This is a simple portfolio website I created using basic HTML and CSS. The site features two main pages: Home and Contact. The Home page introduces my work and projects, while the Contact page provides easy access for visitors to reach out to me.

Features:

1.Minimalist Design: The website has a clean and simple layout that focuses on content and usability.

2.Responsive: The site is designed to be accessible on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

3.Straightforward Navigation: With just two pages, users can easily find information about my work and contact details.

4.Check out the code and feel free to provide any feedback or suggestions!
